This repository contains some of my Arduino projects that I think may be of use to someone.


## lidlRemoteSockets ##

This is a sample code to control a wireless socket sold from LIDL stores under the name SilverCrest 66538.
The code only includes the transmitter sequences for the socket that corresponds to the D button of the remote.

You will need a cheap 433.92Mhz transmitter on pin 2 to test the code.
